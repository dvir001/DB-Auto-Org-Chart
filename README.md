# SimpleOrgChart

> **Note:** This repository is a maintained fork of [jaffster595/DB-Auto-Org-Chart](https://github.com/jaffster595/DB-Auto-Org-Chart).

SimpleOrgChart is a Flask application backed by Azure Active Directory (Entra ID) data that renders a fully interactive, client-side organisation chart. A static JavaScript front end (vanilla JS + D3) consumes cached Graph API data, offers rich filtering, and exposes an admin dashboard with compliance-friendly exports.

## At a Glance

- Hardened security defaults: strict Content Security Policy, sanitized redirects, login isolation, and placeholder-secret protection.
- Modular front end: no inline scripts or styles; shared CSS variables power `configure`, `reports`, and org chart experiences.
- Daily automation: background scheduler refreshes Azure AD data (20:00 local time) and persists JSON caches under `data/`.
- Admin reporting: missing managers, filtered users, and last-login inactivity insights—each with one-click XLSX export.
- Export tooling: SVG/PNG/PDF org chart capture and server-backed XLSX generation for the current chart tree.
- Deployment ready: ships with Docker Compose and a Gunicorn configuration (`deploy/gunicorn.conf.py`) for containerized hosting.

## How It Works

| Layer | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Flask backend (`simple_org_chart/` package) | Serves templates/static assets, authenticates admin endpoints, manages schedulers, and stores cached Graph API responses.
| Static front end (`static/*.js`) | Renders the D3 org chart, configuration UI, and reports dashboard using cached JSON.
| Data cache (`data/*.json`) | Holds employee hierarchies, report snapshots, and last login activity to reduce Graph API calls.
| Scheduler | Nightly job (20:00) refreshes employee data; manual refresh endpoints and CLI helpers are available.

## Prerequisites

1. Docker Desktop (or Docker Engine with the Compose plugin) for container-based deployment.
2. An Azure AD tenant with privileges to create app registrations and grant Graph application permissions.

## Azure AD Setup

1. **Create an App Registration**
   - Azure Portal ➜ Azure Active Directory ➜ App registrations ➜ **New registration**.
   - Choose a name (for example, `SimpleOrgChart`) and leave Redirect URI empty.

2. **Assign Microsoft Graph Application Permissions**
   - `User.Read.All`
   - `LicenseAssignment.Read.All` *(required for licensing insights and admin reports)*
   - `AuditLog.Read.All` *(required for last sign-in metrics and disabled-user audit timestamps)*
   - Grant admin consent for the tenant.

3. **Create a Client Secret**
   - Certificates & secrets ➜ **New client secret**.

4. **Capture Identifiers**
   - Application (client) ID → `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
   - Directory (tenant) ID → `AZURE_TENANT_ID`

## Configure Environment Variables

Copy the template and fill in your secrets.

```bash
cp .env.template .env
# edit .env with tenant/client IDs, secret, admin password, etc.
```

**Required values**

- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` – Directory (tenant) ID.
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` – Application (client) ID.
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` – Client secret value.
- `TOP_LEVEL_USER_EMAIL` – Email for the org chart root user.
- `ADMIN_PASSWORD` – Protects `/configure` and `/reports`.
- `SECRET_KEY` – 64+ character random string for Flask sessions.

Generate a strong secret key:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

**Optional values**

- `TOP_LEVEL_USER_ID` – Explicit Graph object ID for the root user.
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` – Comma-separated list of allowed cross-origin hosts.
- `RUN_INITIAL_UPDATE` – Set to `false` to skip automatic data refresh at startup.

## Running the Application

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```

- Default port: `5000`. Adjust `docker-compose.yml` to map a different host port.
- Persistent data resides in the `orgchart_data` volume. Remove it to rebuild caches from scratch.
- Local execution outside Docker is not supported; use the provided container workflow for development and production.

## Key Features

- **Interactive D3 Org Chart**: Pan, zoom, and expand/collapse hierarchies with persistent hidden subtrees.
- **Search & Discovery**: Real-time directory search, quick navigation helpers, and configurable filters for guests/disabled users.
- **Configuration UI** (`/configure`): Adjust styling, filtering, export columns, and scheduling without editing files.
- **Admin Reports** (`/reports`):
  - Missing managers
   - Users by last sign-in activity
   - Employees hired in the last 365 days
   - Users hidden by filters
- **Export Options**: SVG/PNG/PDF snapshots and XLSX exports for reports and chart data.
- **Caching & Scheduling**: JSON caches regenerate nightly; manual refresh endpoints keep data current on demand.

## Reporting Caches

- `data/employee_data.json` – Full org hierarchy.
- `data/missing_manager_records.json` – Missing manager snapshot.
- `data/disabled_user_records.json` – Disabled users enriched with license and sign-in metadata.
- `data/last_login_records.json` – Active users with last sign-in timestamps.
- Additional files exist for filtered/disabled-with-license/hiring reports.

If a cache is missing or stale, hit **Refresh Data** on the reports page or start the app with `RUN_INITIAL_UPDATE=true`.

## Security Guidance

- Store secrets in Azure Key Vault or your host’s secret manager; never commit `.env` files.
- Restrict `/configure` and `/reports` behind reverse-proxy auth if deployed on the public internet.
- Monitor `AuditLog.Read.All` usage—limit consent scope to required admins.
- Rotate `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET` regularly and update the environment accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

- **Graph permission errors**: Ensure admin consent is granted; check logs for 403 responses when fetching `signInActivity`.
- **Stale data**: Run `curl -X POST http://<host>/api/update-now` (with admin auth) or remove the `data/*.json` caches and restart.
- **Export failures**: Confirm `openpyxl` is installed (bundled via `requirements.txt`). The API returns a 500 with JSON error details if export dependencies are missing.
- **Missing logos**: Upload custom branding via `/configure`; static assets persist in `data/`.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. Please document new locale strings in `static/locales/en-US.json`, update report caches when introducing routes, and include manual validation steps if automated tests are not available.

SimpleOrgChart keeps your organisation chart and admin insights in sync with Azure AD while staying lightweight, portable, and secure.
